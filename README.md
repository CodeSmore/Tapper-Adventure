An Android RPG with a "Tapper" Style Battle System

Multiple worlds, each with their own puzzles, enemies, special abilities to find, and even their own bosses.

I heard people get lonely in single-player worlds, so we included a snarky sign to guide the way ^_^

NOTE: This crashes on Android unfortunately, but it works in Editor and desktop. This was a recovered version from a damaged hard drive, so we take what we can get T.T
